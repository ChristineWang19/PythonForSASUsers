    "For years I used SAS® software in my professional career.  I have always been impressed with its flexibility, its ability to manage large data sets and its ability to take input from just about any source.  These characteristics help to explain its ubiquity in businessed throghout the world.  In the early days of data analysis business users had few choices for tools when it came to doing ad-hoc analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the  tools available then was Base SAS® software.  For clarity, we will refer to SAS and Base SAS as the language as opposed to the company, SAS Institute.  Back then, there was no concept of self-serve, so users were mostly left to queue their requests for analysis and reports to a central IT group.  Eventually, a few intrepid users discovered that SAS software was used for mainframe capacity planning. Mainframes were the dominate systems back then, and their costs were large enough to warrant the practice of analyzing utilization.  SAS was the primary software used for this activity.  CEO’s needed to know when they were obliged to deliver a substantial capital expenditure check to IBM. \n",
    "\n",
    "By taking matters into their own hands users learned the mechanics of submitting SAS batch jobs (no interactive processing back then) and soon discovered they too could access data, munge it, and produce the sorts of reports and analysis that had meaningful impacts.  As the number of computing platforms expanded thought the 1980’s and 1990’s SAS became available for them as well.  All of which lead to a substantial number of SAS users.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this sounds quaint in light of today’s ability to visit a web page and by simply clicking a few buttons, you can spin-up a cluster of hundreds or even thousands of machines with an enormous number of open-source (and proprietary as well) software components.  All of this is available in a matter of minutes by just using credit-cards.   A lot has changed since back then.  And that’s my motivation to write these examples, in the spirit of learning additional ways to analyze data.  \n"

    "There are plenty of substantive open source software projects out there for data scientists, so why choose Python?  After all, there is R.  R is a robust and well-supported language written initially by statistician for statisticians.  The view is not to promote one solution over the other.  The goal is to illustrate how the addition of Python to a SAS user’s skill set can broaden ones range of capabilities.  And besides, Bob Muenchen has already written, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAS-SPSS-Users-Statistics-Computing/dp/1461406846\">R for SAS and SPSS Users.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has its heritage in scientific and technical computing domains and it has a compact syntax.  The latter making for a relatively easy language to learn while the former means it scales to offer good performance with massive data volumes.  This is one of the reasons why Google uses it so extensively and has developed an outstanding tutorial for programmers."
